Comparative Study of GCD Algorithms in Multiple Languages

Overview:
This project benchmarks and compares six methods for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD):
Euclidean Iterative, Euclidean Recursive, Stein’s Iterative, Stein’s Recursive, Subtraction Method, and Built-in functions—all implemented in Python, Java, C, and C++.

Performance is evaluated across various input sizes, providing practical insights for algorithm and language selection.

Algorithms Covered:

1.Euclidean Algorithm (Iterative)

2.Euclidean Algorithm (Recursive)

3.Stein’s Algorithm (Iterative)

4.Stein’s Algorithm (Recursive)

5.Subtraction-Based GCD

6.Built-in GCD Functions

Features

1.Multi-language benchmarks: Python, Java, C, C++

2.Detailed timing analysis

3.Input edge cases tested

4.Comprehensive tables and performance graphs

Getting Started:

Prerequisites

Python 3.x,
Java (JDK 8+),
GCC (for C) and G++ (for C++),
Excel or spreadsheet software (for data/graph viewing)

Running Benchmarks

Compile/run each implementation according to the folder instructions.

Use the supplied benchmark scripts or methods inside each language’s directory.

Enter the results in the provided Excel sheet or your own template for analysis and graphing.

Benchmark Setup

System: Intel i5 11th Gen, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 4GB Nvidia GTX 1650

Runtime Environment: As specified in blog/report for each language

Results Overview

1.C and C++ offer superior performance, especially with built-in functions

2.Euclidean iterative method is generally fastest for manual implementations

3.Subtraction method is not recommended for large numbers due to poor efficiency

4.Built-in methods in each language are highly optimized and preferred for production
